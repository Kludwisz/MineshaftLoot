# MineshaftLoot

Repo for generating mineshafts and simulating mineshaft decoration features such as chest loot, cobwebs, etc.  
The code doesn't take lava lakes, water lakes & caves into account, so it's not 100% accurate.  
Requires seedfinding libraries by Neil and Kaptainwutax to run (https://github.com/SeedFinding)

Mineshaft generator by Gaider10
